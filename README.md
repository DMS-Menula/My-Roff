# Roff Language 🚀

Welcome to my Roff repository! 👋

This project is written in **Roff**, a markup language historically used for formatting Unix manual pages (`man` pages). It's a powerful tool for creating well-structured technical documentation in Unix-like systems.

## 📌 What is Roff?

**Roff** (also known as *troff*, *nroff*, etc.) is a family of text formatting programs used to write documents that are typically formatted for printing or display on Unix terminals.

It’s one of the earliest markup languages and is still used today for Unix man pages.
